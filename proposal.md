### Lifestyle Homesearch

### Pitch

Home search is standardized, but it's all the same. It's time to build a search applicaiton that finds the homes that's right for you using image recognition and pattern analysis.

### Problem

Home search as stands lets you define parameters such as number of beds/baths, square footage, general neighborhoods, and lot size. But it's a bit rigid, as you have to already know where you might want to go. That's all fine more or less if you're moving within the same city, but say if you go out of state. You might not know where is best, how much room you'll want there, etc.

### Solution

Introducing the lifestyle homesearch! While number of bedrooms and home size are still important, it's time that a search exists that lets you find a home that's right for you. What areas of town might you be interested in based on your interests? Let us figure it out. Are you a young adult fresh out of college and like being near the night life? Let's look downtown or where the best concerts are! Are you ready to settle down and start a family? We'll make sure you're looking at quieter neighborhoods with good schools, and easy access to the services you need the most. No matter your lifestyle, interests, or general needs, we'll make sure that your home search is personalized specifically for you to help you find that perfect home.

### Target Audience

This app is primarily aimed at prospective home buyers, but can easily be used by realtors as well. Home buyers will be able to find the home that's right for them based on their interests, and realtors will be able to design the most optimal search for their clients after establishing a working relationship with them.
